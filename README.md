## About The Project
A small game built using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">Turtle Python Library</a>.

The goal of this project is for education purposes, and for having fun.


## How To Play The Game:
you should type the name of the cities that you know and if you type the correct name then the name of the city will 
print on the map. 

You must know that:

1. if you want to see **the solution** you can type ``Solution``, a map of all the cities in Algeria.

2. if you want to **exit** the game type ```Exit```.

then the game will generate a "missing_cities.csv" file that contains all the missing cities in your answers.
